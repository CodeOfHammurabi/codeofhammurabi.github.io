Hello! My name is Krishna Girish (he/him), and I'm a global change ecologist, using mathematical models and large datasets to predict how large-scale environmental perturbations affect ecosystems. My primary aim is to use these techniques to identify ecosystems at risk, predict their future trajectories, and isolate effective conservation interventions. Since September 2024, I have been working as a Researcher in the [BioDICée](https://biodicee.edu.umontpellier.fr/) group at [ISEM, University of Montpellier](https://isem-evolution.fr/) in France. As part of this, I have been working on the [Climtip](https://www.climate-tipping-points.eu/) project, using simulations of future climate conditions to predict and model exposure dynamics of global biodiversity, with a particular interest in extreme events like heatwaves, droughts and cold spells. 

Broadly, my interests lie in using general mathematical frameworks from dynamical systems, network models, and probability theory, coupled with machine learning, data analytics and simulations to predict how large interacting biological systems respond to environmental changes. This entails developing both rigorous analytical approaches as well as synthesizing and confronting theoretical predictions with empirical datasets. 

In May 2024, I completed a BS-MS with Distinction in Biology (with a minor in Mathematics) from [IISER, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) in India. For my masters' thesis, I worked with [Prof. Serguei Saavedra](https://sites.google.com/site/sergueisaavedra/) in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I used tools from the framework of empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and causal inference to assess determinants and trajectories of post-perturbation recovery in human gut microbiota. I've also worked extensively on thermal ecology and geographical ranges using large public datasets and meta-analysis techniques- I have a long-running project with [Prof. Umesh Srinivasan](https://ces.iisc.ac.in/?q=user/408) at the Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES), Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India to use community science data (sourced from eBird) to model [upward range shifts in montane birds](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.13133). Additionally, I am also working on another project to identify determinants of thermal maxima plasticity in plant populations across the world, and have studied whole-genome splicing architectures using bioinformatic clustering algorithms. See more about these on the Projects page of this site.

When I'm not cooking up some sort of variation on the Lotka-Volterra equations or some elaborate function in RStudio, I enjoy [birdwatching](https://ebird.org/profile/MzUwODg4/world), with a particular fondness for montane and coastal ecosystems. I listen to a lot of indie rock music (and make arrangements for the violin), write [quiz questions for global quiz leagues](https://zql.co.in), and [write poetry about nature and science](https://creesmas.substack.com). I also play a lot of [competitive Pokemon](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com). I have an [Erdos-Bacon-Sabbath](https://erdosbaconsabbath.fandom.com/wiki/Erd%C5%91s-Bacon-Sabbath_Wiki) number of 15. 

You can find more about my projects, publications, and my résumé in the other tabs on this site. Feel free to reach out to me at **krishnasg AT gmail.com** if you want to know more or potentially collaborate on something cool- I'm interested in pretty much anything relating to birds, ecological theory, dynamical systems modeling, or the anthropocene.
